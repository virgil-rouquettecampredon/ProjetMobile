## Presentation
As part of our computer training, we had the challenge of creating an Android application in Java. This application has to offer a service to a certain number of online users. This includes account and profile management and user interaction.

To realize this project, we wanted to take up a [previously developed project](https://github.com/virgil-rouquettecampredon/PROJET-TERL3), still within the framework of our studies, a modular chess set. We therefore took this code base in Java, to adapt it to the framework of this new project.
